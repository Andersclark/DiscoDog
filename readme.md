# DiscoDog

Sometime I come home after a day of writing code and still feel like writing more code. That's when I try to write weird stuff. Like DiscoDog!
Basically it's just a function for generating random hex-based color codes. The rest is just sugar.

See it in action on https://andersclark.github.io/DiscoDog/  (enable browser sound, otherwise it's no fun).
